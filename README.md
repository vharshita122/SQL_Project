Music Database SQL Analysis üéµ
Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a music database using SQL queries. The queries were written and executed in pgAdmin 4, and the results were compiled into a PowerPoint presentation for better visualization and explanation.

Steps Followed
1Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding the Database Schema
The database contains multiple tables, including Artist, Album, Track, Genre, Invoice, Customer, and more.
Relationships between tables were examined to design meaningful queries.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Writing SQL Queries in pgAdmin 4
Queries were written to extract insights such as:
Most purchased tracks
Top albums with the most tracks
Highest spending customers
Most popular genres
Total revenue generated
The queries were tested and optimized for performance.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Exporting Results to PowerPoint (PPT)
The SQL queries and their outputs were compiled into a PPT presentation.
Visualizations and explanations were added to enhance understanding.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Uploading to GitHub
The PPT file, along with SQL scripts, was uploaded to GitHub for documentation and sharing.
